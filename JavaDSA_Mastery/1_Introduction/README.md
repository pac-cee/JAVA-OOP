# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways to organize and store data for efficient access and modification. Examples: arrays, lists, trees, stacks, queues.

## What are Algorithms?
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Examples: searching, sorting, traversing.

## Why are DSA Important?
- Efficient problem solving
- Used in real-world applications (apps, games, web, databases)
- Essential for coding interviews

## Exercise
- List 5 real-life examples where data structures are used (e.g., contact list, browser history).
