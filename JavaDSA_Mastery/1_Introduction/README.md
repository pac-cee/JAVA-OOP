# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to your DSA journey! Mastering data structures and algorithms is key to becoming a skilled Java developer, acing interviews, and building efficient software.

## What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways to organize and store data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

**Examples:**
- **Array:** Like a row of mailboxes, each with a unique number.
- **Stack:** A stack of plates (last in, first out).
- **Queue:** A line at a ticket counter (first in, first out).
- **Tree:** Family tree or organization chart.
- **Graph:** Social network connections.

```
[Array] -> [Stack] -> [Queue] -> [Tree]
```

## What are Algorithms?
Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.

**Examples:**
- Sorting a list of names alphabetically
- Finding a friend in your contact list (search)
- Navigating from home to office (shortest path)

## Why Learn DSA?
- Write faster, more efficient code
- Solve complex problems with confidence
- Excel in coding interviews and real-world projects
- Build scalable software (used in apps, games, databases, etc.)

## Visual: Real-Life Analogy
- **Google Maps:** Uses graphs and shortest-path algorithms
- **E-commerce Cart:** Uses stacks/queues for undo/redo
- **Contact List:** Uses arrays/lists and search algorithms

## Common Pitfalls
- Choosing the wrong data structure for a problem
- Ignoring time/space complexity

## Exercise
- List 5 real-life examples where data structures are used (e.g., contact list, browser history).
- Draw a diagram of a data structure you use every day!
