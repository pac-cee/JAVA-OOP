### Q: Do I need to memorize all algorithms?
A: No! Focus on understanding patterns and problem-solving strategies.

### Q: How do I choose the right data structure?
A: Consider the operations you need (insert, delete, search, etc.) and their time complexities.

### Q: What is the best way to practice DSA?
A: Solve problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, and implement structures from scratch.

### Q: How do I visualize algorithms?
A: Use online tools like VisuAlgo, Visualgo.net, or draw diagrams on paper.
