# 18. Project and Practice

## Overview
Apply everything you've learned by building real backend projects, using Git, and collaborating.

## Topics
- Building a full-stack or backend-only project
- Version control with Git
- Collaboration and code reviews

## Example: Simple Project Structure
```
myapp/
  src/
    main/java/
    main/resources/
  pom.xml
  README.md
```

## Exercise
- Build a RESTful backend for a TODO app with Spring Boot.
- Use Git for version control and push your code to GitHub.
- Collaborate with a friend: review each other's code and merge pull requests.
