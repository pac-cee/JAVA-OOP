# Assignment 1 OOP Solution

This folder contains the solutions for the three exercises in the OOP assignment:

- **Exercise 1:** Advanced Stock Management System
- **Exercise 2:** Advanced Online Shopping System
- **Exercise 3:** Advanced Motor Vehicle Insurance System

Each exercise is implemented in its own subfolder for clarity and modularity. All required validations and reporting features are included. User input is handled via `Scanner` as instructed.

## Structure

- `/Exercise1_StockManagement/`
- `/Exercise2_OnlineShopping/`
- `/Exercise3_InsuranceSystem/`

Each subfolder contains the relevant Java classes and a main class to run and test the solution.

**To run:**
- Open the desired subfolder in your IDE.
- Compile all `.java` files.
- Run the `Main` class for that exercise.
