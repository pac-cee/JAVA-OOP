## Advanced Challenges
For each project, consider adding these advanced features:

1. **Persistence**
   - Database integration
   - File storage
   - Caching mechanisms

2. **API Development**
   - REST API design
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - API documentation

3. **User Interface**
   - Web interface
   - Desktop application
   - Mobile app

4. **Additional Features**
   - Logging system
   - Monitoring
   - Analytics
   - Reporting

## Development Best Practices
1. Start with UML diagrams
2. Write clean, documented code
3. Follow SOLID principles
4. Include unit tests
5. Use version control
6. Document your code
7. Handle errors appropriately

## Study Tips
1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with core functionality
   - Add features incrementally
   - Test as you go

2. **Focus on Patterns**
   - Learn one pattern at a time
   - Understand when to use each pattern
   - Practice implementing patterns

3. **Code Review**
   - Review your own code
   - Get feedback from others
   - Learn from examples

4. **Documentation**
   - Write clear documentation
   - Include setup instructions
   - Document design decisions
