# Object-Oriented Programming Mastery

This project is a comprehensive guide to mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It contains practical examples and explanations of all essential OOP concepts, design patterns, and best practices.

## Core OOP Concepts

### 1. Encapsulation
- Data hiding and bundling
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, package-private)
- Getters and setters
- Immutable objects

### 2. Inheritance
- Single inheritance
- Method overriding
- Super keyword
- Final keyword
- Abstract classes
- Multiple inheritance through interfaces

### 3. Polymorphism
- Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)
- Method overriding (runtime polymorphism)
- Dynamic method dispatch
- Type casting and instanceof operator
- Covariant return types

### 4. Abstraction
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Default methods
- Functional interfaces
- Marker interfaces

## Advanced OOP Concepts

### 5. SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### 6. Design Patterns
- Creational Patterns
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype
- Structural Patterns
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Proxy
- Behavioral Patterns
  - Observer
  - Strategy
  - Command
  - State
  - Template Method

### 7. OOP Best Practices
- Composition over Inheritance
- Programming to interfaces
- Loose coupling
- High cohesion
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

### 8. Advanced Java OOP Features
- Generics
- Enums
- Nested classes
- Anonymous classes
- Lambda expressions
- Reflection

## Project Structure

Each concept has its own package with:
1. Example implementations
2. Common use cases
3. Best practices
4. Anti-patterns to avoid
5. Practice exercises

## How to Use This Project

1. Start with core concepts (packages 1-4)
2. Move to SOLID principles (package 5)
3. Learn design patterns (package 6)
4. Study best practices (package 7)
5. Explore advanced features (package 8)

Each package contains:
- Source code with detailed comments
- Unit tests demonstrating usage
- README with explanations and exercises
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Read the concept explanations in each package's README
3. Study the example implementations
4. Complete the practice exercises
5. Run the unit tests to verify your understanding

Remember: Mastering OOP is not just about knowing the concepts, but understanding when and how to apply them effectively.
