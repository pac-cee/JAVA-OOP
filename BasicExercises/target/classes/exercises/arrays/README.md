# Array Operations Exercises

This package contains exercises focused on array manipulations and algorithms in Java.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Array initialization and manipulation
- Prime number generation
- Array traversal and operations
- Algorithm implementation using arrays

## Solutions Overview

### ArrayOperations.java
- `generateFirstNPrimes(int n)`: Generates an array containing the first n prime numbers
  - Uses an efficient algorithm to check for prime numbers
  - Implements helper method `isPrime(int num)` for primality testing
  - Time complexity: O(n * sqrt(n)) where n is the input number

## Best Practices Demonstrated
- Modular code organization
- Efficient algorithm implementation
- Proper method naming conventions
- Use of helper methods for code reusability
