# Encapsulation (Advanced)

- Encapsulation ensures data integrity and security.
- Use immutable classes, validation in setters, and defensive copying.
- Combine encapsulation with design patterns (e.g., Builder, Singleton).

## Mini-Project: Bank Account
- Create a `BankAccount` class with private balance, deposit/withdraw methods, and transaction history.
- Enforce rules (e.g., cannot withdraw more than balance).
- Use encapsulation to protect sensitive data.

See `EncapsulationDemo.java` and try extending it!
