# Inheritance (Advanced)

- Deep inheritance hierarchies vs. composition
- Method overriding and `super`
- Abstract classes and template method pattern
- Risks: fragile base class, tight coupling

## Project: Employee Management System
- Base class: `Employee` (fields: name, id, salary)
- Subclasses: `Manager`, `Developer`, `Intern` (custom behaviors)
- Demonstrate polymorphism and method overriding

See `InheritanceExample.java` and expand with your own classes!
