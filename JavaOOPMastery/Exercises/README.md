# Java OOP Mastery: Exercises

Practice and reinforce your OOP knowledge with these exercises, organized by topic. Try to solve them on your own before checking any solutions or asking for help!

## 1. OOP Basics
- Create a `Book` class with fields for title and author, and a method to display details.
- Write a `main` method to create two books and display their details.

## 2. Encapsulation
- Create a `BankAccount` class with private balance, public deposit and withdraw methods, and a getter for balance. Prevent negative balances.

## 3. Inheritance
- Create a `Vehicle` superclass and subclasses `Car` and `Bicycle`. Each should have a unique method.

## 4. Polymorphism
- Create a `Shape` superclass with a `draw()` method. Subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` should override `draw()`.
- Write a program that stores different shapes in an array and calls `draw()` on each.

## 5. Abstraction
- Create an abstract class `Employee` with abstract method `calculateSalary()`. Subclasses `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` implement it.

## 6. Composition & Aggregation
- Create a `School` class that has a list of `Student` objects. Add methods to enroll and list students.

## 7. SOLID Principles
- Refactor a class that handles both file reading and data processing into two separate classes.

## Real-Life Project Mini-Exercises
- Expand the Library Management System to handle overdue books.
- Add transaction history to the Banking System.
- Implement a discount system in the E-commerce Mini System.
- Add a computer player (AI) to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game.
