# Polymorphism (Advanced)

- Compile-time vs. runtime polymorphism
- Interface-based design
- Double dispatch and visitor pattern

## Project: Payment System
- Interface: `PaymentMethod` (method: pay)
- Implementations: `CreditCard`, `PayPal`, `Crypto`
- Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by processing payments with different methods

See `PolymorphismDemo.java` and try implementing the project!
