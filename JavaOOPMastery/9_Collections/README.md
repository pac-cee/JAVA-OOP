# Java Collections Framework

## What are Collections?
Collections are data structures provided in Java to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.

### Main Interfaces:
- **List** (ArrayList, LinkedList)
- **Set** (HashSet, TreeSet)
- **Map** (HashMap, TreeMap)
- **Queue** (PriorityQueue, LinkedList)

## Why Use Collections?
- Dynamic sizing
- Built-in methods for searching, sorting, etc.
- Used in almost all real-world Java projects

## Example
```java
import java.util.*;
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Alice");
names.add("Bob");
System.out.println(names);
```

## Exercise
- Create a program that stores student names in a `Set` and prints them in sorted order.
- Use a `Map` to associate student names with their grades.
