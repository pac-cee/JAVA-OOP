- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

## Example
```java
// Single Responsibility Principle
public class ReportPrinter {
    void print(Report report) {
        // printing logic
    }
}
```
