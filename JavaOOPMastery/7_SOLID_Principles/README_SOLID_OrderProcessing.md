# Order Processing System (SOLID Refactoring Project)

This project demonstrates how to refactor a monolithic order processor into SOLID-compliant classes.

- Start with `OrderProcessor.java` (non-SOLID)
- Refactor into separate classes for each responsibility (e.g., Payment, Notification, OrderRepository)
- Apply each SOLID principle and document improvements

Try extending the code and see how maintainability improves!
